<h1 style="text-align: center;">DailyWiki</h1>
<h2>Get a new Wikipedia article directly in your taskbar, every day</h2>
<p>DailyWiki is a desktop application for Windows that finds a random Wikipedia article and displays a link for it every time you log in your Windows session. The article does not have to be completely random, though: the application provides you with a settings menu that allows you to pick specific topics your articles will be selected from.
DailyWiki is automatically executed when you open your session. All you need to do is to click the message that will be displayed in Windows' system tray to discover a new article!</p>
<h2>Features:</h2>

 - Access a random article just by clicking the message displayed in the bottom-right corner of the screen when you log in your session
 - You can change the settings to get a totally random article, or an article selected from topics you selected (10 at most)
 - DailyWiki is launched at startup by default. This can be changed in the settings
 - Easy installation: just run the installer provided.

<h2>How it was made:</h2>
<p>This app was entirely coded in Python, using the popular Python binding for the popular GUI framework Qt. The source code is frozen to create a Windows executable so that the user does not need to install Python to run the app. Articles are requested from Wikipedia using the Wikipedia API.
